          <h3>Advantages of AI in Social Media</h3>

          <h5>1. AI boosts the revenue of the social media companies</h5>

          <p>
            Many social media companies have applied AI to their products, eg. Facebook. Social media companies can make use of the large database of users with AI. For example, Facebook developed an AI tool called Deeptext, which analyses the text in conversations and deciphers the contents that users posted. Facebook then leads relevant advertisers to the users based on the conversations and posts they made. It provides advertising links to the users who might have potential interests. Advertisement targeting creates a large amount of revenue for the companies.

          <h5>2. AI improves the using experience of social media</h5>  

         <p>
            There are lots of handy and useful functions in social that are supported by AI technology. In Youtube, one of the largest and the most popular online video sharing platform, AI is used to make smart recommendations to the audience, which helps them to find videos in which they are interested quickly and accurately. Instagram uses AI for similar purpose. Posts are recommended to the users by analysing the past posts browsed by the users. In Facebook, there is also a AI-based automatic translation system, which facilitates interactions between users. All those functions offer the users with smoother and easier experience.
