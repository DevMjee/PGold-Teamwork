            One of the most obvious aspects in media using AI technology is online searching. It includes not only
            searching for information, but also recommendations or suggestions and even the way how people find the content.
            As matching users' demands is the foundation of today's media industry, AI is utilized to identify the best or the possible
            matching results for customers by analysing massive data sets. This application is usually advertised as 'personalization'.
        </em></p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal text-white"><em>
            It is efficient to use AI to satisfy user's demands immediately and clearly. However, the problems gradually emerged.
            For years, the companies like Netflix and Facebook are using AI to give users the most related movies or website pages
            by prior choices. There is a conjecture that people will be only provided with the relevant information based on the
            previous data, rather than the huge amount of information on the internet.
        </em></p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal text-white"><em>
            As a result, the concern is that people's perception of the world may be narrowed by AI. In other words, personalization may filtrate the ideas that
            you may disagree with and present more opinions you prefer. It may deepen people's fixed thought rather showing them there are
            other various ideas.
